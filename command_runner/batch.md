urrent Architecture (Lambda + EC2 + Custom Orchestration)

  How it works:
  - Lambda receives trigger (manual or EventBridge scheduler)
  - Dynamically modifies EC2 UserData with command arguments
  - Launches EC2 instance that:
    - Mounts EFS + S3 buckets via mountpoint-s3
    - Sets up local NVMe storage
    - Clones code from GitHub
    - Executes command_runner.py with YAML config
    - Runs sequential shell commands
    - Self-terminates on completion
  - Custom Python orchestrator handles task execution, logging, and notifications

  Comparison: Current System vs AWS Batch

  PROS of Your Current System

  1. Maximum Flexibility
    - Shell commands with full access to filesystem, environment variables
    - Easy to modify and test - just edit YAML files
    - No container image builds required for config changes
    - Simple mental model: "run these bash commands in order"
  2. Storage Architecture Fits Your Use Case
    - Local NVMe storage (c6id instances) for high-performance I/O
    - EFS mounts for shared packages (/data/packages, /data/dp_tool)
    - S3 mountpoint-s3 for direct S3 access
    - This combination is harder to replicate in containers
  3. Low Overhead
    - No Docker layer
    - Direct EC2 metal performance
    - Faster startup (no container pull) - just git clone
  4. Deployment Simplicity
    - Single CloudFormation stack
    - No ECR image management
    - Code updates via git pull (controlled by git_branch parameter)
    - YAML configs live in repo, no separate job definitions
  5. Debugging
    - Can launch with no_shutdown: true to investigate failures
    - Full shell access via SSM
    - Logs go to CloudWatch + S3
  6. Perfect for Your Workload
    - Long-running, resource-intensive data processing
    - Heavy local disk I/O (CASS/NCOA on RAM disk)
    - Need for specific instance types (c6id.24xlarge)

  CONS of Your Current System

  1. Manual Resource Management
    - You handle instance lifecycle, shutdown logic
    - No automatic retry logic (would need to add)
    - Error handling is your responsibility
  2. Limited Parallelization
    - Single instance per job
    - Can't easily parallelize task stages (though your data isn't amenable to splitting)
    - No built-in array job support
  3. Bootstrapping Overhead
    - Every run: mount EFS, git clone, mount S3 buckets, setup environment
    - ~2-3 minutes startup time before actual work begins
  4. Less Observable
    - Custom CloudWatch logging
    - Manual SNS notification logic
    - No built-in job queue visibility
  5. Scaling Coordination
    - Can't easily enforce "max N concurrent jobs"
    - Must manage concurrency via EventBridge rules

  PROS of AWS Batch

  1. Managed Orchestration
    - Built-in job queues, scheduling, retries
    - Automatic compute provisioning and termination
    - Job dependencies (JobA → JobB → JobC)
    - Array jobs for parallel processing
  2. Better Observability
    - Native AWS console for job status, logs, metrics
    - CloudWatch integration out-of-box
    - Job history and audit trail
  3. Resource Optimization
    - Automatic instance selection based on job requirements
    - Multi-tenant compute environments (multiple jobs per instance)
    - Spot instance integration with automatic failover
  4. Standardization
    - Industry-standard container approach
    - Better for teams familiar with Docker/ECS
    - Easier to migrate to Kubernetes later if needed
  5. Concurrency Control
    - Job queues with priority
    - Compute environment limits
    - Fair share scheduling

  CONS of AWS Batch

  1. Storage Complexity for Your Use Case
    - EFS works, but less straightforward than direct mounts
    - S3 access via AWS CLI/SDK (no mountpoint-s3 in containers easily)
    - Local NVMe storage requires EC2 launch type + specific instance types
    - Volume mounts and permissions become container concerns
  2. Container Overhead
    - Must package your code into Docker images
    - Image build/push to ECR on every code change
    - Larger images = slower startup
    - Your heavy dependencies (CASS/NCOA data, Melissa Data) harder to containerize
  3. Reduced Flexibility
    - Can't easily "SSH in and run commands"
    - Debugging requires log inspection or custom entry points
    - Less control over exact execution environment
  4. Migration Complexity
    - Would need to containerize:
        - Your command_runner.py + dependencies
      - All shell scripts
      - CASS/NCOA setup (RAM disk creation)
      - Melissa Data tools
      - MPI processing tools
    - Convert YAML configs to Batch job definitions
    - Rewrite Lambda to submit Batch jobs instead of launching EC2
  5. Cost Considerations
    - Batch itself is free, but:
    - May run larger instances (less bin-packing efficiency for your huge jobs)
    - ECR storage costs
    - Potential for longer-running overhead
  6. Your Workload Doesn't Fit Batch's Strengths
    - You run 4-5 scheduled jobs/day, not hundreds
    - Jobs are large, monolithic, sequential
    - No array/parallel patterns
    - Heavy local storage requirements

  Recommendation: Stay with Current System

  Why Your Current Approach Makes Sense:

  1. Your data processing is I/O-bound and needs:
    - Local NVMe storage (c6id instances)
    - RAM disks for CASS/NCOA
    - S3 mountpoint for multi-TB datasets
    - EFS for shared packages

  → Batch containers would complicate this significantly
  2. Your jobs are already well-isolated
    - One EC2 instance per job
    - Self-contained, self-terminating
    - No shared state between runs

  → You don't benefit from Batch's multi-tenancy
  3. Your orchestration is simple
    - Sequential shell commands
    - No complex dependencies
    - EventBridge schedules 4 jobs/day

  → You don't need Batch's advanced scheduling
  4. Your team's workflow
    - Iterating on YAML configs + shell scripts
    - Quick testing with git branch switching
    - No Docker expertise required

  → Containerization would slow development

  When You Should Consider AWS Batch:

  - If you need to run 100s of jobs/day with queuing
  - If you want to parallelize stages (e.g., process 50 files independently)
  - If you're building a multi-tenant platform where other teams submit jobs
  - If you need sophisticated retry/dependency logic
  - If you want to run on Fargate for smaller jobs

  Improvements to Current System Instead:

  1. Add retry logic to Lambda
    - Detect failed jobs (CloudWatch event)
    - Automatic relaunch with same parameters
  2. Add job queue simulation
    - DynamoDB table for job queue
    - Lambda checks queue before launching
    - Enforce max concurrent jobs
  3. Pre-baked AMI
    - Build AMI with git repo, packages, mounted EFS
    - Reduce startup time from 3min → 30sec
  4. Better monitoring
    - Parse CloudWatch logs into metrics
    - Dashboard showing job status, duration, costs
    - SLA monitoring for daily jobs
  5. Task-level parallelization
    - If certain YAML tasks can run in parallel (e.g., different data sources)
    - Launch multiple EC2 instances from one Lambda invocation
    - Use S3 for coordination
